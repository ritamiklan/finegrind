# Mobile app done with React Native

- currently still working on the structure of the screens and components.
  Next steps:
- fixing the behaviour of the nested navigation
- adding the map functionalities
- write proper documentation instead of these bullet points

To do list:

- add photos to the database - added mock images
- split up the code to screens - sort of done
- implement navigation between screens - needs to be properly fixed, buggy
- coords need to be added to API
- map screen with location
- make UI somewhat nice-ish
